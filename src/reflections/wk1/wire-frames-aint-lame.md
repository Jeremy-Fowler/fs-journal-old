#Wire-frames ain't lame

##What is the purpose of wire-framing?

Creates a rough visual representation of what you want your project to look like

##What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

A low fidelity wire-frame is the least detailed type of wire-frame, and is used for getting a base layout for your project. Can be a drawing on a piece of paper.

A medium fidelity wire-frame is likely written in code and is still a very basic conceptualization. Will most likely have place-holder images, different shades of gray representing colors, etc.

A high fidelity wire-frame is showing more of what the actual concept will end up looking like.

##Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I do believe that wireframes are very useful. They can not only help you visualize what your project will end up looking like, but can help other people visualize this as well. Making bigger changes on low/medium fidelity wireframe would also be much easier than trying to do rather than trying to change a project that is near completion.
