##What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

A Pseudo-Class is a class that activates only under certain conditions, such as hovering your mouse over an object. I beleieve that I will use :root, :active, and :hover pretty frequently.

##What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specifity decides which rule should be applied to an element if it is being targeted by two different rules.

##What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

Coding with Specifity in mind seems to be more important than using an override. Code structure could get very messy and it could be difficult to tell at a glance which rule would be applying when.
