# Vue Tests

## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Testing allows you testing of code in isolation.

Component Testing allows you to test larger components of your application via the DOM and ensuring that they are working within the Vue Framework.

End-To-End tests go over your entire application when a user is actually interacting with it.

## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I prefer component testing, since it gives direct feedbcak that something is working in a visual way.

## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

E2E tests seem to be the least useful to me, since every aspect of the application should have already been tested.
