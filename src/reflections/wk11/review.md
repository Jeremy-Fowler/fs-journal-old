This course has been very important to me. I'm a highschool dropout and a college dropout. The majority of my work experience has been in labor jobs and training/overseeing people in labor jobs. This course has elevated my self worth by an incredible ammount.

Concerns: My main concern for the final is spending too much time troubleshooting single issues. If I find myself losing too much time while trying to fix one problem, I plan to move on and revisit this problem with a fresher perspective.

Time: I have already turned down multiple social engagements this weekend, and I plan to spend the majority of my time on the weekend working on my backend server. Throughout the week, I plan on coming home, working out, playing with the foster kittens, eating dinner, and coding until I need to sleep.

I've enjoyed so much about this course. All of the staff are fun to be around. I haven't been excited to learn new things in a very long time. The feeling you get when your code runs correctly has never gotten old, and I feel like it never will.
