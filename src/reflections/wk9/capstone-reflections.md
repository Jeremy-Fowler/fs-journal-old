# Capstone Reflections

## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We are creating a RESTful application that is using Firebase for online storage.

## What went well so far?

Setting up our server has been a smoother process than on previous projects.

## What would you do differently? Why?

I would set up our Trello differently so that's it easier to read and easier to dole out tasks.
