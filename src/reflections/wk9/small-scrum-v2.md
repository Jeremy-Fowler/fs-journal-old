# Small Scrums V2

## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?

Using Scrum in a small team can be much different than on a larger team, for example on our team of 3 we did not feel the need to have a Scrum Master, and we found that having small, frequent standups was a good way to keep us on track.

## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.

Working on one sprint at a time keeps the team on track, it keeps the team focused on what needs to be accomplished at this given time, and it keeps your priorties in order.

## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?

Good, cheap, fast service does not exist.

Good, cheap service won't be fast
Good, fast service won't be cheap
Fast, cheap service won't be good

It keeps the team's expectations realistic, as well as the client's.
