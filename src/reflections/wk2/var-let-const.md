# Var Let and Const

## What is Scope ?

Scope describes where these variables are available for use.

## What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is a process that js uses to basically double-check through your code and moves declarations and variables to the top of code

## In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

var should be used when we want to use it within the entire code, and we want to be able to update it multiple times

let is used the most frequently, and we would want to use it within functions where it can be redefined

const cannot be reassigned.
