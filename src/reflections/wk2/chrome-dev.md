# What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

The main ways to write information to the console is to use the console.log() function in your own code, or to invoke functions directly from the dev tool console.

## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The Elements tab allows you to see the breakdown of your HTML/CSS. This tab is very useful for styling your existing code on the fly, rather than making lots of finetuning adjustments within your own code.

## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Using the debugger command in your own code is a great way to debug your code step-by-step.
