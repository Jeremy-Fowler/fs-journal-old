# C# Data Types

## What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value Type: Data type that conatins values

Reference Type: 

Pointer Type:

## What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

bool
byte
char
decimal
double
enum
float
int
long
sbyte
short
struct
uint
ulong
ushort

Must be very descriptive when creating a variable.

## In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

A Reference type stores the pointer to where the actual data is being stored in memory.

A Value type stores the data in memory without the need for a pointer.
