# Reflections

## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

This week my partner and I used pair-programming for the majority of our project.

## What went well?

Pair-Programming was very useful for building our app, and I feel like my partner and I have a much better understanding of coding thanks to it.

## What would you do differently?

I would switch between driver and navigator more frequently, and I would not have worried about splitting up later in the project for efficiency. I beleieve that we coded more efficiently as a pair rather than solo.
